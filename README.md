# Enhanced Battle Test

A mod for Mount&Blade Bannerlord that can test battle locally.

## Features
- Test Battle Mode: You can choose where to spawn troops and they will be all spawned instantly.

- Custom Battle Mode: Use built-in mechanism to spawn troops. Troops that exceeds the battle size limit will be spawned later.

- Siege Battle Mode: Use AI for siege battle. Add deployment stage.

- Map selection. Including sergeant maps, skirmish maps, tdm maps and some siege maps.

  Siege maps may crash. Due to incompleteness of AI navigation mesh and other entities in siege maps, AI may perform poorly in those maps.

  Custom battle mode contains sergeant maps only, because only sergeant maps contains corrrect spawning positions that custom battle mode requires.

  If you want more maps, you can edit the config file yourself, details below.

- Character selection. You can specify at most three types of troops for each team.

  Also you can select **perks** that is consistent with those in Multiplayer mode.

- Configuration saving. The battle configuration is saved in "(user directory)\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs\EnhancedBattleTest\".

  The configuration for Test Battle mode is saved in "EnhancedTestBattleConfig.xml" and that for Custom Battle mode is saved in "EnhancedCustomBattleConfig.xml".

  You can modify it to add more maps, but if you edit it incorrectly, the configuration will be reset to default, or the game may crash. I don't guarantee anything.

- Switching player's team. You can switch between player agent and the enemy commander to control their troops respectively.

- Controlling your bots after dead.

- Switching free camera.

- Undead mode. Any agent will not die after switched on.

- Changing AI tactic options.

- Adjusting combat AI between 0 and 100.

- Customizing player characters, details below.

## How to install
1. Copy `bin` and `Modules` into Bannerlord installation folder(For example `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord - Beta`).

### Note
- Due to a bug in official code, if a game update changes multiplayer perks (so that it updates `Native\ModuleData\mpclassdivisions.xml`), the mod will crash.
  
  You can wait for mod update or play multiplayer mode. If you want to play this mod instantly, you should remove spaces between xml elements in `mpclassdivisions.xml`(I use vscode with `XML tools` extension to automatically do that) and make a backup up of it. You should then reinstall the mod and overwrite this file using the backup.

- Please read `How to customizing characters` section for details and reason.

## How to use
- Start the mod by clicking `EnhancedBattleTest.bat` in `bin\Win64_Shipping_Client` that you have copied into Bannerlord installation folder. If it crashed, try to run `EnhancedBattleTest-Alternative.bat` instead.

- You can select troops for each side of teams.

- Press `F` key or `F10` key to control one of your troops after you being killed.

- Press `F9` to switch your team.

- Press `F10` to switch between free camera and main agent camera.

- Press `F11` to disable death.

- Press `F12` to reset mission (available in `Test Battle mode` only).

- Press `O(letter)` to adjust more settings including team AI tactic options, etc.

- Press `P` key to pause game.

- Press and hold `TAB` key for a while to exit the battle scene.

- Press `I` key to get player or camera position.

- Press `L` key to teleport player when in free camera mode.

## How to add more maps
- You can go to `Modules\Native\SceneObj` to find available maps.

- To add more maps, you need to edit the configuartion file(in folder `(user directory)\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs\EnhancedBattleTest\`).

- The maps available in mod are under the xml element `sceneList`.

  The element `SceneInfo` represents a map and related config.

  So you need to add a `SceneInfo` element as a child of `sceneList`, just like the other maps.

  For example you can copy the text between `<SceneInfo>` and `</SceneInfo>`, then replace the text between `<name>` and `</name>` with the folder name of the map you want to add.

  The other config like formation positions can be configured in the game.

## How to customize characters
- To customize characters, you need to provide XML element `NPCCharacter` and `MPClassDivision`.

- `NPCCharcter` defines character name, the culture it belongs to, body properties, equipment, etc.

- `MPClassDivision` defines perks, armor, movement_speed, etc. which are properties used in multplayer mode. As this mod use the same mechanism as multiplayer mode to spawn characters, you have to define `MPClassDivision` to make the `NPCCharacter` you defined to appear.

- The identity of `NPCCharacter` and `MPClassDivision` are determined by `id` attribute. Characters with the same id are the same one, and the one defined later will overwrite the one defined earlier(except that equipment list are concatened and equipments will be chosen from the list randomly).

  You need to specify the id of `NPCCharacter` in `hero` and `troop` attribute of `MPClassDivision` to associate them with each other.

- If you only need to customize less than 4 characters, You can customize your characters by modifying the xml elements with id `player_character_1`, `player_character_2` and `player_character_3` in `Modules\EnhancedBattleTest\ModuleData\customcharacters.xml`.

- If you need more than 3 characters, then:

- In `customcharacters.xml`, add your character with different `id`. For example you can copy-paste an existing character, change `id` to a new one, and modify other properties as you need.

- In `Modules\EnhancedBattleTest\ModuleData\mpclassdivisions.xml`, add a `MPClassDivision` element associated with your character. For example, you can copy-paste an existing `MPClassDivision` element, change `id` to a new one, then change `hero` and `troop` attributes to the `id` of your character, at last modify other properties as you need.

- You may wonder why I don't put customized `MPClassDivision` into a separate file such as `customclassdivision.xml`, just like what I do for `NPCCharacters`, which will make it more convenient for you to install mod update. It's because since Bannerlord b0.8.0(maybe since earlier version, I don't know), merging two `mpclassdivisions.xml` files, and parsing them is **NOT** correctly implemented: the spaces between xml elements are not ignored, and the game will crash.

- A work-around is to remove all the spaces between XML elements in files defining `MPClassDivision` and keep your customized content in a seperate file. But this way may be inconvenient compared with copy-pasting your customized content into `mpclassdivisions.xml` each time you install the mod update.

- Hope to see this bug fixed soon.


## Build from source
The source code is located in the `source` folder or available at [https://gitlab.com/lzh_mb_mod/enhancedbattletest](https://gitlab.com/lzh_mb_mod/enhancedbattletest).

1. install .net core sdk

2. modify 6th line of `EnhancedBattleTest.csproj`, change `Mb2Bin` property to your bannerlord installation location

3. open a termial (powershell or cmd), run `dotnet msbuild -t:install`. This step will build `EnhancedBattleTest.dll` and copy it to `bin\Win64_Shipping_Client`

## Troubleshoot
- If it shows "Unable to initialize Steam API":

  - Please start steam first, and make sure that Bannerlord is in your steam account.

- If the mod crashed without entering Main menu:

  - Try to run `EnhancedBattleTest-Alternative.bat` instead of `EnhancedBattleTest.bat`.

    This works for some people. Or:

  - Reinstall the mod. If not working:


  - Wait for mod update. I would appreciate it if you sent the crash report to me, details below.

- If the mod crashed when clicking buttons in main menu:
  
  - If you customized characters, please make sure the files you modified are syntax correct. You can reinstall the mod if you cannot get it work.

- If the mod crashed when selecting numbers in battle config UI:
  
  - This is caused by bugs in Bannerlord. Maybe you can avoid to trigger this bug.

- If the mod exited without showing any message when loading battles:

  - Try to reduce soldier numbers or graphic quality.

- If the mod crashed in battle (except in siege map):

  - Please send the crash report to me and wait for a fix.

### How to send crash report to me
- Click `Yes` when it says 
  > The application faced a problem. We need to collect necessary files to fix this problem. Would you like to update these files now?

- In `bin\Win64_Shipping_Client\crashes\` folder, there should be a folder shows the crash time. Sent the files in this folder, espacially the dump.dmp file to me. My mail address is below.
